					I have had problems controlling ammonia levels in smaller aquariums that I use for fry rearing
					because they tend to become overpopulated quickly. Sponge filters and HOB power filters just
					seem to fall short. So, I'm down-sizing my moving bed filter to minimize the height for a 20
					gallon long tank. The tank stands about 12 1/2 inches high, but given room for a little substrate
					and space at the top so that the water doesn't splash out, I have about 10 inches of water column
					to work with. Subtract from that an inch or so above the filter for the bubbles to escape, and
					also I don't want the sponge quite touching the sand or gravel bottom.<br/>
					<br/>
					This article was written after I had already tested this design to make sure that the media would
					tumble in a reactor made from a jar without a funnel-shaped neck. I took it apart to make some
					small improvements and I am documenting it while it is de-constructed, therefore some of the parts
					are already drilled, but if you read my previous article from
					<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://moving-bed-diy.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">moving-bed-diy</a>,
					much of this article should be a review. Take note of the sponge assembly however as, unlike the
					previous design, it does not require parts off a sponge filter, just a pre-filter sponge and some
					short pieces of PVC and CPVC pipe.<br/>
					<br/>
					First, just a note on drilling plastic (or PVC/CPVC). If you have some duct tape, taping the area and
					marking locations on the tape will help in a few ways; it is easier to write on, helps keep the drill
					bit from slipping, and limits burrs from forming around the holes to some degree.

			<ul>
				<li>
					Using a 1 1/8 inch hole saw, drill a whole in the center of the jar lid. This should precisely fit the 1/2 inch bulk-head
					fitting. Drill approximately 8 holes equally spaced around the jar lid using a 5/32 inch drill bit.
				</li>
				<li>The jar needs approximately 8 holes in the bottom, using the 5/32 inch drill bit. Keeping in mind that the jar will be inverted,
					make the holes such that they will be at the highest point, so if there is a ridge that the jar sits on, drill the holes at
					fairly even intervals along that ridge.
				</li>
				<li>
					Using a 5/32 inch drill bit, drill lots of holes in the CPVC pipe, but leave about 1/2 inch alone at one end. This perforated
					pipe will be the water intake inside the pre-filter sponge.
				</li>
				<li>Tape and mark the jar for at least 2 vertically aligned holes in one side for the suction cup mounts. If using 4 suction
					cups, the 4 holes should form the corners of a rectangle where the horizontal sides are very short. The reason you want the
					suction cups close together horizontally, is due to the curvature of the jar. Unless you plan to stick it to the corner
					of the aquarium. If that is the case, you are on your own, but it's not a bad idea now that I think about it. Anyway, using a
					3/16 inch drill bit, drill a hole for each suction cup. With needle-nose pliers and a chopstick, insert each suction cup
					as described in my previous article.
				</li>
				<li>
					Using a 7/32 inch drill bit, drill a hole in the PVC street elbow for the airline. Refer to the photos below [ie Fig-2] to make sure
					of the placement of the hole, you don't want the airline coming out of the bottom of the pipe where it will take up more
					vertical space.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.25em; margin-top: 1em; font-family: Verdana,Arial;">Assembly</h2>
			<p>The photos in this section are slightly non-chronological, but its all real simple if you just study the photos.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Insert the bulk-head fitting in the jar lid such that the smooth side with the gasket is inside the lid as shown [Fig-1].
					Hand tighten the bulk-head nut on the outside [Fig-2] so that it is secure, don't worry about leaks, everything will be dry fit
					and we aren't concerned with any connections being watertight.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cut a length of airline tubing long enough to go from your air pump to the filter, or perhaps a gang valve to the filter.
					Feed an end through the hole in the PVC elbow and grab it from the threaded side of the elbow with a tweezers or needle-nose
					pliers and pull it through [Fig-3].
				</li>
				<li>
					Press the short piece of 1/2 inch PVC into the open end of the PVC elbow, then press the unperforated end of the CPVC pipe
					into that 1/2 inch PVC pipe [Fig-4 and Fig-5].
					Pull enough airline through the elbow to thread it through the bulk-head fitting in the jar lid,
					then screw the PVC elbow into the bulk-head fitting. Insert the airstone into that end of the airline tubing [Fig-6].
					Now pull on the airline from the opposite end until the airstone is seated flush with the bulk-head collar as shown [Fig-7].
				</li>
				<li>
					Fill the unit about half way with media. I'm using EasyPro Pond Products Ultimate Tube Media (UTM1) [Fig-8].
				</li>
				<li>
					Screw on the jar lid, slide the sponge on, and you are ready to install it [Fig-9].

			<p style="display: block; float: contour; margin-top: 0.25em; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.25em;">
				Submerge the filter as low as possible, but allow clearance around the sponge so it is not obstructed. Try to maintain an inch
				or so of water above the unit. When submerging, water will flow into the unit from the bottom holes, you
				should ring the air out of the sponge, stick it to the glass and try to get it as vertical as you can. Finally, attach the air pump.
				<br/>
				Given the squareness of the peanut butter and similar jars, it may take a few days for the media to tumble, but it will happen once the
				media begins to be weighted down with bio-film.
