# moving-bed-diy
Tumblr article on how to make a moving bed filter for a vertically-challenged tank.

One evening I spent a few frustrating hours typing HTML into the dinky Tumblr editor, was too tired to
review it before retiring for the evening and hit 'save a draft'. The next morning, I could find no
trace of any draft, so I started over in my favorite HTML/CSS editor (NetBeans). Once the article looked
right in my web browser, I pasted it into the Tumblr editor, hit preview, and then had to iterate a
few times because it does not allow for a <header> block, so CSS style has to be inline and there were
some other subtleties, but if you figure you are just grabbing everything inside, but excluding the <body>
tags, you should be good.

Once I published the article, I figured I'd check it in here to take advantage of the usual benefits and
to share in case anyone else hadn't thought to do this.
